# PasswordGenerator

This password generater works as so:
When you press 'Generate Password' you are given five prompts
First, "How many digits do you want the password to be?" Here you have a choice between 8 and 128 characters.
second, "Do you want lowercase letters in your password?" This and the rest of the questions are yes or no but atleast one of them has to be yes to progress
Third, "Do you want Uppercase letters in your password?"
fourth, "Do you want numbers in your password?"
and fifth, "Do you want special characters in your password?"

Once you've made your selection, the JavaScript will generate you a password and it is written to the text box for you to copy.
